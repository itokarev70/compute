Assumptions:

- Compile is in `Unix(LF)` format. Encoding: `UTF-8`

- Numbers (except threshold and limit) are entered one per line

- `Enter` is pressed after each number

Processing is triggered by one of the following:

- `EOF` keystroke (`Ctrl+D` in Unix, `Ctrl+Z` in Windows)
  
  Note: you still need to press `Enter` after last number

- 100 numbers were entered
